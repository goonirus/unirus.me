                <h2>1. Definition of Game</h2>
                <p>
                    The question "What is a game?" has been discussed for many years by researchers and game designers. Also for public, different people can define games in their different ways. In academia, from Huizinga's (1938) experience-centered and "not serious" perspective to Salen & Zimmerman's (2003) rigorous system-based model, each definition reflects a different emphasis—some focus on structure and rules, some highlight experience, even conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my view, a good definition of a game should combine the systematic structure and the player experience. Games are not only systems of rules, but also activities that make players think, decide and feel. They have goals that guide the player's actions, and these actions lead to emotions and interactions that allow players to gain spiritual value.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    So my definition is: A game is a system with rules and goals where players make decisions that can affect what happens, and this process gives them emotional and interactive experiences, provides spiritual value.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This definition highlights three essential aspects: the formal structure of rules, the player's capacity of meaningful decision-making, and the emergent experience created by interaction. These aspects reveal games as spaces shaped by both player intention and structural design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition also mentions an uncommon and abstract concept "Spiritual value", which requires an explanation: It includes spiritual growth, deeply moving tragic aesthetics, pure happiness, and other things that you personally find valuable on a spiritual level. So, this definition of games depends heavily on you personally. If a product called "game" by most of people but you feel it like nothing more than a waste of time, then under this definition, it isn't a game for you.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Concepts of the Definition Compared with Other Theories</h2>
                <p>
                    In this section, I don't want to compare each theory one by one. Instead, I will use a framework that compares each concept individually and then compares the relevant theories. I believe this method of categorization is clearer and more suitable for refining the definition.
                </p>

                <h3>2.1. Rules and Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost every researchers regard rules as a prerequisite for games. D. Parlett (1999) succinctly states, "every game is its rules". C. Crawford (1984) calls a game "A closed formal system". This is echoed by the course textbook author, T. Fullerton et al. (2004) "A closed formal system", and Salen & Zimmerman (2003) "A game is a system in which players engage... defined by rules". J. Juul's (2005) six-point model also begins with "Rules" as its first criterion. J. Huizinga (1938), R. Caillois (2001) and Avedon & Sutton-Smith (1971) also mentioned rules in their definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the researchers' perspective, a game is defined as a system with rules in my definition. Rules give the game structure, boundaries and logic. Without rules, there is only free play, not a game. If we define games without rules, the definition of a game becomes so broad that it loses its value altogether. Rules are not only restrictions but also the framework that makes decisions meaningful. (When you play a game with children and they don't follow the rules, you get really annoyed.) They tell players what is feasible, creating the conditions for interaction and emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And not all things with rules are system. For example, rolling dice to see the number, which includes rule, but it isn't a game when it isn't a system. However, no matter how small a structured and rule-based system is, like a designed frisbee game (we will mention in Borderline Cases), it can still be considered a game while it meets the other criteria of the definition.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2. Goals and Outcomes</h3>
                <p>
                    A "goal" or "outcome" is a common thread in most definitions. C.C. Abt (1970) states it as "seeking to achieve their objectives". G. Costikyan (1994) includes the "pursuit of a goal". Stricter definitions focus on the outcome of the goal: Fullerton's (2004) "unequal outcome", Salen & Zimmerman's (2003) "quantifiable outcome"; and Avedon & Sutton-Smith's (1971) "disequilibrial outcome". Juul (2005) splits this concept in two: "Variable, quantifiable outcome" and "Value assigned to possible outcomes".
                </p>
                <p>
                    By comparing and analyzing those definitions, I adopted "goal" instead of "outcome" as a constraint in my definition. An "outcome" seems more like the objective result of a game, but that's not necessarily what the player looking for. If a player give up before seeing the outcome of the game, does that mean what they played can't be considered a game? I want to emphasize player intention rather than system output. I hope players can use my definition to find their own dynamic understanding of what a game is, setting their own "goals" to establish the meaning of the game. Just like the choices in life, the outcome of a game might not what the player pursuit in the game. Goals in games are not always about winning or losing; they can also be about exploration, creation, or understanding.
                </p>

                <h3>2.3. Player Participation and Decision-making</h3>
                <p>
                    Many researchers emphasize that games cannot exist without active players making meaningful decisions. C.C. Abt (1970) and Von Neumann & Morgenstern (1944) both describe games as "interactive decision problems", highlighting that participation is a necessary condition for play. G. Costikyan (1994) and C. Crawford (1984) expand this idea by stressing interaction—players continuously make meaningful decisions that affect the game state, turning abstract rules into lived experience. Juul (2005) and Salen & Zimmerman (2003) further connect this process to player effort and meaningful play, arguing that choices must have perceivable consequences that give players a sense of involvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my definition, I describe a game as a system "where players make decisions that can affect what happens", which means rules alone do not make a game, but the interaction makes the game alive. Therefore, my view is the similar to theirs: I consider player agency, especially Juul's (2005) idea of "player effort", as the heart of a game. If players' decisions are invalid, it isn't a game, but a film.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, my definition of player might different with some of them. In some of their context, such as G. Costikyan's (1994), "player" may only refer to humans. But in my definition, a player is who can gain emotional and interactive experiences as well as spiritual value. As a result, it could be some sentient animals, like dogs.
                </p>

                <h3>2.4. Conflict and Competition</h3>
                <p>
                    Conflict is discussed by several theorists, but it does not mean competition. Crawford (1984), Fullerton (2004), and Salen & Zimmerman (2003) all list it explicitly. Bernard Suits's (1978) definition, however, provides the most precise articulation: the "voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles". He explains that the function of "constitutive rules" is to "prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means". At the same time, competition is also mentioned as a defining concept by Caillois (2001) and Avedon & Sutton-Smith (1971).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suits's (1978) definition perfectly explains the relationship between "rules", "goals", and "decisions" in my definition. The reason a player must "make decisions" is because the rules ("unnecessary obstacles") forbid the simple, decision-less path to the goal. (A console is acceptable, but it cannot be considered part of the in-game rules.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I did not use the word "conflict", as it can easily be understood as opposition, excluding cooperative and single-player games. For the same reason, I also don't consider "contest" or "Agôn” as a definition of games, which is too one-sided.
                </p>

                <h3>2.5. Freedom and Voluntariness</h3>
                <p>
                    The notion of freedom is central in many classical definitions of games. Huizinga (1938) defines it as "a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life". Caillois (2001) also placed "freedom" at the very beginning of his definition. At the same time, Suits (1978) and Avedon & Sutton-Smith (1971) regarded playing games as a "voluntary effort".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did not inherit the scholars' view of voluntary. If we are playing a game arranged as part of a course, does it fail to meet the definition of "playing a game" simply because it is not voluntary, even if we genuinely enjoy it? At the same time, the definition of freedom is also not clear enough. If I am held at gunpoint, I still have the choice to resist. Does that count as freedom?
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I guess what they actually meant was "willingness." In my definition, this aspect is covered by "spiritual value"—if the player still feels unwilling in the end, they probably cannot gain any "spiritual value."
                </p>

                <h3>2.6. Uncertainty and Chance</h3>
                <p>
                    Theories of games often regard uncertainty as a key element that gives play its tension and meaning. Caillois (2001) identified "Alea" (chance), as one of the four fundamental forms of play, emphasizing the fascination of surrendering to fate and the thrill of unpredictable results. Fullerton (2004) described uncertainty as essential to the design of conflict and challenge—without an unknown outcome, player engagement quickly disappears. Juul (2005) also included variable and quantifiable outcomes in his definition, arguing that uncertainty transforms effort into suspense, making results emotionally significant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my understanding, randomness is not a necessary condition for games. Many games lack random elements, such as Go or chess. However, uncertainty is essential, reflected in the opponent's unknown next move, or a decision whose outcome you do not know in advance. In my definition, uncertainty is implied in the expression "decisions that can affect what happens". If everything is certain, it means the player's actions cannot affect the system—in that case, it is not a game, but a film.
                </p>

                <h3>2.7. Fiction and Magic Circle</h3>
                <p>
                    Many classical theories describe play as existing within a distinct frame separated from ordinary life. Huizinga (1938) introduced the idea of the magic circle, a symbolic space where new meanings emerge through play. Caillois (2001) extended this by seeing games as voluntary systems of order, temporarily detaching players from real-world obligations. Later, Salen & Zimmerman (2003) and Juul (2005) reinterpreted this separation as flexible and psychological rather than absolute, suggesting that the boundary between play and reality is continuously negotiated through interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I do not believe that the game world and the real world are completely separate. This view no longer applies to many contemporary games, especially motion-sensing games. Not to mention that the emotions evoked by games are closely connected to reality. The views of Salen & Zimmerman (2003) and Juul (2005) are closer to the modern understanding of games. However, I believe this distinction has little significance today, which is why I did not include it in my definition.
                </p>

                <h3>2.8. Some one-sided concepts</h3>
                <p>
                    Concepts such as resource management mentioned by Costikyan (1994), or competition mentioned in 2.4, are one-sided views and should not be included in a universal definition. Due to word limitations, they will not be listed one by one here.
                </p>

                <h3>2.9. Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the comparative analysis above, my definition differs from traditional ones by emphasizing the player's experience. For players, this definition allows them to determine whether a system is a game based on their own understanding of "goal", "motional and interactive experiences", and "spiritual value". For designers, they should focus on whether the game includes an explorable "goal" and enough player experience in order to gain players' recognition of their work. This, in my view, is the soul of a game.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Borderline Cases</h2>

                <h3>3.1. High Jump</h3>
                <p>
                    In several classical definitions, the high jump is not considered a game. Huizinga (1938) and Caillois (2001) argue that professional sports is "not serious" and "unproductive", creating no material wealth or profit. Suits (1978) would also exclude it, since the goal is external rather than self-imposed, and Costikyan (1994) notes that it lacks meaningful decision-making beyond physical execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a tricky case, as it is a rather monotonous competitive sport. However, if it were a motion-sensing fitness game, could it be considered a game? I believe it could. If we design a competition for such a game and offer prize money, does that mean it is no longer a game? Probably not. Therefore, I believe these are not concepts that determine whether an activity qualifies as a game. In my definition, it still depends on the participant's attitude. If an athlete truly enjoys themselves while doing the high jump, who can deny they are playing a game?
                </p>

                <h3>3.2. Sudoku</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Crawford (1984) and Costikyan (1994), Sudoku falls outside the definition of a game because it lacks interaction and decision-based uncertainty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my definition, it can be a game if you gain enjoyment from it. The concept of uncertainty in my definition is broader, while the possibility of failure caused by your own mistakes also fits the definition of "players make decisions that can affect what happens". Meanwhile, I believe Sudoku involves interaction, between the player and the rule-based system.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3. Gambling</h3>
                <p>
                    Gambling challenges the idea of non-productivity central to Huizinga (1938) and Caillois (2001). When real money is involved, the play becomes instrumental and loses its voluntary purity. Suits (1978) and Juul (2005) also question whether pure chance games qualify as games at all, since players exert no meaningful agency in influencing outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue depends on the type of gambling. Gambling games like Texas Hold'em are, but purely random forms of gambling are not for most people, depending on whether their decisions cannot affect the outcome. But for a card sharp, the latter answer might also be yes, while it perfectly fits all my definitions.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4. AI vs AI Chess</h3>
                <p>
                    Most theorists, including Crawford (1984), Costikyan (1994), Abt (1970), and Suits (1978), agree that when two artificial agents play chess without human involvement, no real game occurs. Without players, there is no voluntary decision-making or emotional investment only the mechanical execution of rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also not a game in my definition. The system simulates play but does not experience it. For AI, they cannot get "motional and interactive experiences" and "spiritual value"; and for audience, their decision cannot affect what happens. This conclusion also applies to Conway's Game of Life.
                </p>

                <h3>3.5. The Sims</h3>
                <p>
                    Definitions by Caillois (2001), Juul (2005), and Suits (1978) tend to exclude The Sims due to its lack of fixed goals and quantifiable outcomes. Rather than conflict or competition, it offers open-ended simulation and self-expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its structure challenges definitions that require clear victory conditions or measurable success, that is what I mentioned in 2.2 the difference between goals and outcomes. So in my definition, it could be a game, if you define your own goal in the game.
                </p>

                <h3>3.6. Pen & Paper RPGs</h3>
                <p>
                    Role-playing games occupy an ambiguous space. Juul (2005) and Fullerton (2004) note that they often lack formal outcomes or conflicts, focusing instead on collaborative storytelling. For Caillois (2001), they lean toward mimicry rather than Agôn, meaning that performance and imagination replace competition as the core dynamic.

                    That is absolutely a game in my definition. Unlike the rigid definitions of the past, I focus on goals and spiritual value, both of which it fulfills.

                <h3>3.7. Designed Dog Catching a Frisbee</h3>
                <p>
                    Crawford (1984), Costikyan (1994), Abt (1970), and Suits (1978) would not consider a dog catching a frisbee a game. Although it follows rules and involves challenge, the dog is not a conscious decision-maker or meaning creator. Without reflective intention or voluntary choice, the activity remains play but not a game.

                <p>
                    I use this as an example because it involves both boundaries: the rule system and the player. First, it is a system. It has a feedback loop and meets the basic definition of a system. Then, can a dog be considered a player? Different users of my definition may have different interpretations. In my opinion, dog could be. As a sentient creature, dog can understand the simple rules and make decisions that follow the rules and influence the outcome, and can gain spiritual value—the pure happiness.

                <h3>3.8. Interactive Movies</h3>
                <p>
                    Interactive movies occupy a complex position in game theory. Early examples with limited choices often failed to meet Juul's (2005) and Fullerton's (2004) requirements for player agency and systemic feedback. However, modern titles like Detroit: Become Human clearly allow player decisions to alter outcomes, fulfilling the condition of meaningful choice. Even so, some theorists like Crawford (1984) still question whether these experiences constitute full games, since player actions often influence narrative direction rather than systemic state changes. They exist on the border between film and game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My view is similar to that of Juul (2005) and Fullerton (2004): interactive experiences where decisions alter outcomes can be considered as games in my definition. Of course, if a product ends the same way no matter what decision you make, it is not a game but a film.
                </p>

                <h3>3.9. Poorly Designed "Game"</h3>
                <p>
                    If a game meets all the definitions but feels like pure torture to you, while others find joy in it, is it still a game?
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, past definitions were very rigid, so most of them had to acknowledge that it is indeed a game. But not in my definition. So, this is merely a boundary issue of my definition while my definition grants users full agency to reject such a game. You can say "no" if you feel you gain no spiritual value from it, even if everyone else enjoys it, even if it meets all other definitions. For you, it's not a game, just a waste of time. For me, the examples could be The game of ladybirds, Happy Salmon, and Halli Galli.
